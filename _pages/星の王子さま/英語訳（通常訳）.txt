When I was six years old, I once saw a magnificent picture in a book that talked about the Virgin Forest called "True Stories".  
It showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal.  
Here is a copy of the drawing.  
The drawing showed a boa constrictor digesting a wild animal.  
The book said:  
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing.  
After that, they cannot move anymore  
and they sleep during the six months of digestion."  
I thought a lot about jungle adventures.  
And then, it was my turn, I succeeded in drawing my first drawing with a colored pencil.  
My drawing number one.  
It was like this.  
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them if my drawing scared them.  
They answered: "Why would a hat scare anyone?"  
My drawing did not show a hat.  
It showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.  
So I drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grown-ups could understand.  
They always need explanations.  
My drawing number two was like that.  
The grown-ups advised me to set aside the drawings of open or closed boa constrictors and to take interest rather in geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.  
Thus, at the age of six, I gave up a magnificent career as a painter.  
I was discouraged by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two.  
Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiring for children to always and always give them explanations.
